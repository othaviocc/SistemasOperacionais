In a hidden valley among ancient mountains, lived a people who spoke with the stars.
Every night, they lit bonfires and danced to the sound of the winds, telling stories forgotten by time.
The trees held secrets in their leaves, and the rivers whispered songs from distant eras.
No one knew how they had arrived there, but everyone knew they belonged to that place.
It was a world where magic and reality walked side by side, in perfect harmony.
