On the rocky coast of a quiet village stood an old lighthouse, its light sweeping the dark waves every night. The villagers said it was haunted, but no one ever dared to find out why.
Every evening at sunset, a man known only as Elias would walk up the steep path to the lighthouse. He never spoke much and always carried a leather-bound journal. Children whispered that he had a treasure hidden inside, or maybe a ghost locked in the basement.
One stormy night, the lighthouse light went out for the first time in years. A ship was seen drifting dangerously close to the rocks. The villagers, worried for the sailors, climbed the hill to help. When they reached the top, the door was wide open, the light broken—and Elias was gone.
All they found was his journal on the desk. Inside were stories of a shipwreck from 50 years ago, where Elias had lost his wife in a storm. He had kept the light burning every night since then, hoping her spirit would return.
They never saw Elias again, but the light turned on the next evening, glowing brighter than ever. From then on, the lighthouse never failed, no matter how fierce the storm.
Some say it’s Elias keeping watch. Others say it’s the love that never left.
